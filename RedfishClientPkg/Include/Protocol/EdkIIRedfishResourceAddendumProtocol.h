  Edk2 platform Redfish Resource Addendum driver provides this interface to create addendum data
  which is required by Redfish service to manage Redfish resource.

  Redfish feature driver calls this interface with the JSON data on input and Redfish schema
  information. The JSON data contains Redfish attributes that is created by feature driver.
  Based those attributes, edk2 platform Redfish Resource Addendum driver appends addendum data
  to it, or edk2 platform Redfish Resource Addendum driver replaces it with addendum data that
  is required by Redfish service. Then Redfish feature driver sends JSON data to Redfish
  service directly without modification.
